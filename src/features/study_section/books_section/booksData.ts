      "The Psychology of Money is a bestselling book by American finance expert Morgan Housel, published in 2020. In this book, Housel examines people's financial decisions through the lenses of history and psychology. He argues that financial management is a relatively new phenomenon that everyone approaches differently depending on their personal experiences, beliefs, and biases. According to Housel, people who do not have a formal financial education can still succeed financially by learning the psychology of money. The author uses historical anecdotes to illustrate how people's relationship with ego, risk, patience, and effort can make or break their financial success and ends each chapter with a recommendation to the reader.",
